# IndiePaint
A WPF Application that makes a VERY basic paint program.
For designs, I decide to make buttons for everything. Simple and to the point.
There is a basic clear button that wipes the Canvas (named "Canvy" in the program)
and 3 color options. These are all simple, one line of code changes. Then we have the pen increase/decrease
buttons, which increment the pen size by 3 for each button press. The increase was simple; It was the
deacrease in which I had to put a try/catch case so the progrman didn't crash. Pen size can't be negative!

Then we have reset pen (Color back to black, pen eight and width back to 2) funciton and a black color option.

I purposefully put the black away from the others, as it is a base color and should be
treated differently than the other vibrant colors. Also easy to find.
